        <h1>How I Became a Self-Taught Frontend Web Developer</h1>
        <small>Asha Cole</small>
        <p>It has been a dream of mine for years to be able to code. As a young teenager I would be so happy working through codeacademy courses, making a basic website about Loki, playing around with background colors, etc. On the Scratch website, I liked figuring out the basic logic to make things happen and create my own games. At 21, I decided I would finally sit down and be a serious programmer. So I followed hours worth of Treehouse videos. Then, I got a udemy course that went through 50 projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I recreated my own versions of the videos. All the trial and error of not knowing how to create what I wanted, learning to create a little bit of what I wanted, eventually finishing my creation much googling and using Chrome Dev Tool's inspect, hundreds of times, I got better and better at creating. Eventually, I worked up the bravery to build client's projects, and this was an additional layer of invaluable experience. Now, I am at a point where I can see what I want to create in my head, see how those pieces will come together in my programming languages of choice, and make it. It is something I am so happy and grateful that Allah allowed me to acheive. <p>

            <p>Home is a great place to work if you have self-discipline and keep yourself from the distractions. I was able to become a paid coder, get a more flexible body from yoga practice, get closer to my Lord through prayer, all within the four walls of my bedroom.<p>
